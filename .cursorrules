# Cursor Rules for Personal Website

## Link Management
When adding external links to HTML files:
- Ensure they are properly formatted with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links
- After adding new external links, run `python3 tests/extract_links.py` to update the outbound links list
- The outbound links list is maintained in `tests/outbound_links.txt` for debugging and validation

## Testing
- Before committing, run `./tests/check_links.sh` to validate all external links
- The link validation tool uses lychee and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

## Code Style
- Use semantic HTML5
- Keep CSS and JavaScript minimal and vanilla
- Maintain the intentionally minimalistic design philosophy
