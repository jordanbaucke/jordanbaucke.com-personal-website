      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Enterprise Architecture Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/ecosystem-partners/salesforce">Accenture's Salesforce practice</a>, where I focus on applying AI to modern business information systems at scale. My work spans advising clients across health and human services, financial services, and communications, media, and technology, with an emphasis on executive-level decision support and delivery leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my primary focus is leveraging AI APIs to accelerate enterprise workflows and modernize customer relationship platforms such as <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/">Salesforce Agentforce</a>, in partnership with hyperscaler AI providers including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
        My consulting philosophy is grounded in a simple framework: Clients, People, and Practice—delivering measurable outcomes for clients, developing strong teams, and building durable technical capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The values I bring to my work are influenced by long-term business thinkers such as Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway; Harvard Law School) and Warren Buffett (Chairman & CEO, Berkshire Hathaway; Columbia Business School), whose emphasis on clarity, patience, and principled decision-making continues to shape my leadership approach.
