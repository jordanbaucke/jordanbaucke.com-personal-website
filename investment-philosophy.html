      <p>
        My interest in financial markets began early, shaped by a family friend's father who encouraged me to take investing
        seriously rather than treat it as speculation. That curiosity was reinforced by my uncle—an electrical engineer who
        built, scaled, and ultimately sold multiple Silicon Valley companies, several of which went on to trade publicly on
        the American NASDAQ and exit successfully over the course of his career. Watching that arc firsthand made markets feel
        tangible rather than abstract.
      </p>

      <p>
        My fascination with equities and, later, derivatives was also influenced by my family's roots in Chicago, where I spent
        summers growing up. I've long thought of Chicago as the <em>working person's Wall Street</em>—a city defined by commodity
        futures and pit-traded derivatives that persisted well into my lifetime. In college, I probably lost more study hours
        than I should admit sitting in the business school's Bloomberg terminals, pairing a growing understanding of markets
        with an early love of software by building rudimentary options-trading tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was graduating from college as the Global Financial Crisis reached its depths, an experience that permanently shaped
        how I think about risk, leverage, and market narratives. Watching once-trusted institutions fail, correlations collapse,
        and certainty evaporate in real time impressed on me that markets are not purely rational systems—they are human systems
        under stress. That period instilled a lasting skepticism of excess confidence and a deep respect for downside risk,
        liquidity, and resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also been deeply interested in the evolution of market structure and the rise of high-frequency trading, influenced
        in part by <em>Flash Boys</em>, which framed modern markets as both technologically elegant and structurally fragile.
      </p>

      <p>
        While my professional career has been in technology, some of my earliest investing lessons came from far more traditional
        sources—countless hours of CNBC in college, including <em>Mad Money</em> with Jim Cramer. One lesson that stuck early is the
        old adage that the only free lunch in investing is diversification. Because technology is my livelihood, I'm intentionally
        selective about long-term exposure to tech equities. I prefer not to concentrate my capital in the same sector that already
        dominates my professional risk, and I remain mindful that a dot-com-style drawdown occurred just before my adult life and
        investing career began.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I've read widely on investing and trading, I am not a professional money manager or trader. What the process
        <em>has</em> given me is a fairly honest understanding of myself—my strengths, and more importantly, my weaknesses when it
        comes to patience, risk tolerance, and conviction. Markets have a way of being very effective mirrors.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been personally involved in the stock and options markets, trading my own capital, for roughly 20 years. Over that
        time, I've also explored working with external money managers and advisory services, but I've often found myself underwhelmed
        by most ideas presented—perhaps because I've never quite been offered a true partnership to properly stoke my ego 😄📉💸.
        Humor aside, those experiences reinforced my preference for alignment, transparency, and intellectual rigor over polished narratives.
